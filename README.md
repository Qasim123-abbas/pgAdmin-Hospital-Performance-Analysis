🏥 **Hospital Performance Analysis - SQL Project**

This project analyzes hospital performance metrics using PostgreSQL via PgAdmin. The goal is to uncover insights from healthcare data including patient outcomes, hospital efficiency, treatment costs, and more.

📊 **Objective**

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hospital-related data using SQL, identifying key patterns and KPIs that reflect the performance of healthcare institutions.

🧰 **Tools & Technologies**

1.**PostgreSQL** – for writing and executing SQL queries

2.**PgAdmin** – GUI for database interaction

3.**SQL** – for data cleaning, querying, and analysis

4.**Excel/CSV** – data source files

📁 **Dataset**

**Hospitals data:** Basic information about hospitals Hospitalname, admission count ,doctors count , billing cost ,admission date and etc.)

**Problem Statement**

1.Total Number of Patients
   
2.Average Number of Doctors per Hospital

3.Top 3 Departments with the Highest Number of Patients

4.Hospital with the Maximum Medical Expenses

5.Daily Average Medical Expenses

6.Longest Hospital Stay

7.Total Patients Treated Per City

8.Average Length of Stay Per Department

9.Identify the Department with the Lowest Number of Patients

10.Monthly Medical Expenses Report

**Key Learning Outcomes**

**SQL Grouping and Aggregation**: Deepen understanding of grouping data and calculating metrics like average, count, and sum.

**Date Time finctions**:Deep understanding of date time function to find current date , current timne ,current time stamp , total days.

**Join queries**:Deep understanding of joining tables and find relations and values between by joining tables and find values.

**Types of operators**:Deep understanding of operators like Airthmatic ,comparision ,logical ,between like and In operators.


📈 **Insights and Findings**

Certain urban hospitals showed higher efficiency with shorter patient stays.

Treatment costs varied significantly across hospitals and departments.

A few hospitals had exceptionally low mortality rates tied to specific procedures.

Seasonal trends were observed in patient admissions (e.g., spikes during winter).
